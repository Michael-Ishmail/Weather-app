This is my weather app! When a city is searched in the search bar, the current forecast as well as a 5 day forecast are shown. The forecast includes the temperature, wind speed, humidity, the date, and an icon showing the current weather conditions.

Below is a screenshot of the finished application, as well as a git hub pages link to the deployed website.
